To get started running the project, you should start with datapreparation which prepare the final dataset for machine learning approoaches automatically, the only thing you need to do in first step is keeping the input files which are in sas7bdat format in a directory called SASFiles and run the datapreparation.py file. The only SAS files you need to keep in SASFiles directory are cand_kipa.sas7bdat, donor_deceased.sas7bdat, donor_live.sas7bdat and tx_ki.sas7bdat.
